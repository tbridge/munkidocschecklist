# munkidocschecklist
A repository of text files designed to help architect the munki documentation structure.

### Detailed Documentation for Munki

We are a group of Munki users dedicated to bringing more detailed documentation to the Munki project. This is a space meant for helping to craft better working docs for the Wiki, including tutorials, videos and other useful training pieces.

This is designed to be more "Driver's Ed" than "Complete Feature Guide", and will include some basic rules of the deployment road as well as methods for using Munki in this fashion.

We are looking for help, so please email tom@technolutionary.com if you want to take charge of a section.

Thanks!
